## Cretaceous Maze Adventure - Group Project

[Link to Cretaceous Maze Adventure Repository](https://github.com/jonathanwidmer/programmingroupproject)

This is a repository for group projects for group 3 in Mr. Kapptie's programming 2 class. Our project is called Cretaeous Maze Adventure. The goal of the game is to get through a maze with enemy dinosaurs, and after you beat the level with those dinosaurs, you can play again or go to the next level. On the start screen, there will also be options to play the game, see the timeline of the dinosaurs, and look at more resources for learning about them. Our group members are Aaron Wang, Aiden DeBoer, Jonathan Widmer, and William Bastian. Aaron was in charge of class connectivity, Jonathan was in charge of GUI controls and both Aiden and William did graphics. 

The year 2 concepts in our project are:
- ternary statements
- file I/O
- GUI controls
- collections (ArrayLists)
- inheritance

[Final Project Video](https://github.com/aaWang27/aaWang27.github.io/raw/gh-pages/CretaceousMazeAdventure/finalprojectvideo.mp4)

This is not what the final game will look like because we are going to switch to doing it in Processing instead of Java, but this picture explains the concept of the game. The user is represented by blue, and the dinosaurs by red. The user has to go through a maze without being killed by dinosaurs and make it to the end. When they are at the end, they can go to the next level, replay the level, or go back to the title screen and read the instructions, look at the resources, and look at the timeline to learn about the game and the dinosaurs in it.

### Description
This project is a homework tracker for students. It allows them to add and remove assignments.

[Executable Jar File](https://github.com/aaWang27/Programming-2-Portfolio/raw/gh-pages/HomeworkTracker/HomeworkTracker.jar)

[Source Code](https://github.com/aaWang27/aaWang27.github.io/raw/gh-pages/HomeworkTracker/src/HomeworkTrackerCode.zip)

### Documentation
[Video of Homework Tracker running](https://github.com/aaWang27/aaWang27.github.io/raw/gh-pages/HomeworkTracker/doc/homeworkTrackerDemo.avi)

### Year 2 Concepts
The Year 2 Concepts I used were:
* GUI
* Multidimensional arrays
* Enhanced For loops
* Collections (ArrayList)

I also used one ternary statement, and implemented Mouse listeners.

### Future Updates
* One feature I want to incorporate is the ability for the user to save their assignments.
* Settings for the user to decide how they want to organize the assignments would also be useful.
* I also wanted to color code the assignments based on status.


## TicTacToe Game

[Link to TicTacToe Repository](https://github.com/aaWang27/TicTacToeGame)

### Description

This project implements the game of TicTacToe in a graphical user interface, allowing the user to play on the computer. The players click on the square that they want to occupy, and can also restart the game at any time by clicking on the Restart button. After the game is over, the winning player (or Tie) is displayed on the screen.

## Calculator

[Link to Calculator Repository](https://github.com/aaWang27/Calculator)

### Description

This project is a simple calculator that allows for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The user can clear the display, and also use decimal points. If there is already one decimal point in the display, the calculator will prevent the user from adding another one. (e.g., 1.23 is acceptable, but the calculator will prevent 1.23.45) There is currently a rounding error in certain situations.
